The goals for this project are:

1. Determine the primary drivers of sentiment in the flavor text of Magic: The Gathering cards
2. Develop a model to predict the sentiment of flavor text in Magic: The Gathering cards

Deliverables for this project will be a jupyter notebook containing the analysis and any relavent py files needed to run the notebook.

Background info:

Magic: The Gathering is a collectable card game developed by Wizards of the Coast Inc. In a typical game, each player combines the cards they have collected into his or her own deck, which they use to compete against other players. Cards in each players deck represent spells and other resources each player has at there disposal. These cards are devided into different catagories and themes. Each card in the game (or at least the great majority of them) have a flavor text printed on them. flavor text has no mechanical effect on games but serve to reinforce the games themes and thus add “flavor” to the card.
